    <ol>
        <li>Wrap the tofu in 2 layers of paper towels and place on a plate. Put another plate on top of the tofu to weigh it down and microwave for 2-3 minutes, or until drained.</li>

        <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu and cook on all sides until golden brown, 2-4 minutes per side, then remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli to the hot pan with the vegetable broth. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Steam for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and remaining ½ teaspoon of sesame oil. Stir until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, agave, rice vinegar, and cornstarch slurry. Stir until thickened to your desired consistency. Add the sesame seeds and stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Return the tofu to the pan and toss to coat in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve over white rice and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
